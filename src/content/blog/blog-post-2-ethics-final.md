I'm not going to sugarcoat this: the ethics around AI and copyright are complicated. Really complicated. These models train on massive datasets pulled from all over the internet, and yes, that includes copyrighted material. Courts are still sorting through what that means legally, and honestly? We're all watching this play out in real time. It's messy, and anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something.

But here's what I think gets lost in these conversations - there's a massive difference between USING AI as a tool and passing off AI-generated content as your own original work. When you ask an AI to help you brainstorm ten different opening lines for your novel, or to suggest ways to restructure a paragraph that's not quite working, you're using it the same way you'd use a thesaurus or a style guide. The creative thinking? That's still YOU. The decisions about what works and what doesn't? That's YOU. If you take what the AI suggests and reshape it, add your own examples, change the tone entirely - that's authorship. That's craft.

Here's where I draw the line for myself, and you should figure out where yours is too: if you're letting AI generate entire pieces with minimal input from you and then slapping your name on them, that feels wrong to me. Not necessarily because of copyright issues (though those matter), but because it's dishonest about the work involved. On the other hand, if you're using AI to supplement YOUR process while remaining the primary creator and decision-maker, that seems more defensible. You're still doing the real work.

Some AI companies are starting to be more transparent about their training data. Others let creators opt out of having their work included in future training runs. These options matter, and if this stuff concerns you (as it should), seek out tools from companies taking these questions seriously.

Look, I work with these systems every day. I think they're powerful tools. But I also think writers need to approach them with healthy skepticism and clear personal boundaries. Use them in ways that align with your values and feel ethically sound to YOU. If something makes you uncomfortable, trust that instinct. Your moral compass is probably pointing you in the right direction, and that's worth more than any productivity boost a tool can offer.
