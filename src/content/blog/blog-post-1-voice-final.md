Let's face it; we've all heard the mantra: AI is coming for your job. This is something especially prevalent in the creative sphere. While it's true that AI can do things faster than a human can, it can never, EVER replace your voice. It simply can't. AI doesn't think or feel or understand human emotion and connection, or how a scene makes a person FEEL. And because of that, the human element will ALWAYS be needed. AI can't replace it. Full stop.

I've been working with language models on various tasks for several years now, generating everything from code for apps, to images I use for wallpapers on my phone and computer, to poetry and intricately detailed outlines for full length novels. This barely scratches the surface, but I will say that the one thing these models excel at is predicting what typically comes next. Again, that's where the human element comes in. "Typical" is precisely what good writing is NOT. Good writing immerses you in the story world. You feel the heartbreak the characters are feeling, and you smell the coffee they're drinking or the food they're eating. Your heart races as the character stands before an unlit room, knowing something lurks in the shadows. The ways we capture our senses in words, those are things AI can never replicate.

One thing AI can help with is get past that initial hurdle. You have a fragment of an idea, a story you yearn to tell. AI can give you options, help you see possibilities for your story you may not have thought of, a new and exciting path for your characters to take. Maybe it gives you multiple options, and you can choose the one that best aligns with your vision. But then you are off and rolling.

Or it could be that you're struggling with dialogue - like I frequently do - and need some help steering the characters' conversations. The AI can help there too, but that is not the final version. Not ever. The AI can't understand your characters' feelings and motivations like you do, because YOU created them. Take what you wrote, strip it down, rewrite it (as all writers do, usually multiple times), and make it weird. Make it YOURS.

So the AI can help you get the ball rolling when you don't know where to start, but that idea? Those characters? Those are yours. They always have been and always will be. No matter whether you're on your rough draft, your third draft, or your final draft, the material comes from you. This is YOUR universe, and the AI and the rest of us are just living in it. And that is one thing that will NEVER change.
